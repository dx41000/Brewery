SUGGESTED FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS:
CACHING
LOGGING
API VERSIONING
EXPAND UNIT TESTS - CURRENTLY ONLY LOOK AT HAPPY PATHS
ADD SEEDING
ADD ABILITY TO LINK AN EXISTING BEER TO A BAR / BREWERY AS CURRENTLY YOU CAN ONLY LINK A NEW BEER.

THERE ARE TONS OF IMPROVEMENTS I COULD MAKE WITH TIME.  GIVEN ITS A TEST I WILL LEAVE IT HERE
AS I THINK I HAVE SHOWN THE BASIC REQUIREMENTS AND A RANGE OF SKILLS YOU ARE HOPEFULLY LOOKING FOR.

DUE TO TIME LIMITATIONS I HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO TEST EVERY END POINT.
