SUGGESTED FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS:
CACHING
LOGGING
API VERSIONING
EXPAND UNIT TESTS - CURRENTLY ONLY LOOK AT HAPPY PATHS
ADD SEEDING
ADD ABILITY TO LINK AN EXISTING BEER TO A BAR / BREWERY AS CURRENTLY YOU CAN ONLY LINK A NEW BEER.

THERE ARE TONS OF IMPROVEMENTS I COULD MAKE WITH TIME.  GIVEN ITS A TEST I WILL LEAVE IT HERE
AS I THINK I HAVE SHOWN THE BASIC REQUIREMENTS AND A RANGE OF SKILLS YOU ARE HOPEFULLY LOOKING FOR.

DUE TO TIME LIMITATIONS I HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO TEST EVERY END POINT OR AIM AT HITTING EVERY REQUIREMENT EXACTLY.  I HAVE INSTEAD FOCUSED ON DEMOSTRATING VARIOUS CONCEPTS
LIKE DEPENDENCY INJECTION, UNIT TESTING, ENTITY FRAMEWORK, API CODE LAYOUT AND SO ON.  

I ALSO TOOK THE MODEL DESCRIPTIONS AS HAVING TO BE MAINTAINED.  I WOULD OF NORMALLY ADDED IN IDS TO THE DTO AND SO ON (IF NO SECURITY CONCERN IN DOING SO). I DID ADD LISTS AS THIS WAS A STATED REQUIREMENT.
